## Feature ideas

- [ ] Add a "create folder file" command.
- [X] Generate TypeScript types for "content types" based on the Frontmatter of the files in the templates directory (consider discriminated unions).
- [ ] Ability to generate notes of a given content type based on a directory in my Google Drive (e.g. books).
- [ ] Ability to reorder the Frontmatter properties of every file using a certain content type.
