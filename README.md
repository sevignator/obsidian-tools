# Obsidian tools

This is a set of commands that allow me to more easily and conveniently create new Markdown files for my Obsidian vault.

## Getting started

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your local copy of this repo, and add the following key/value pairs:

    - `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
    - `OBSIDIAN_ARTICLES_DIR`
    - `OBSIDIAN_BOOKS_DIR`
    - `OBSIDIAN_COURSES_DIR`
    - `OBSIDIAN_VIDEOS_DIR`
